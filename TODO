TODO
- Add logging for debugging etc.
- Create a dummy folder/flow data structure, and play with the left pane
- Make resources work like they do in Designer
- Component titles should be centered (needs using text instead of static text?)
- Moving a Component must also cause all attached wires to adjust
- Deleting a Component must delete all attached Wires.
- External links in README should point to archive.org


TERMINOLOGY

To be more specific in what's what, I'm adapting to something akin to 'electronic circuit board' terminology. Leaving the (presentation-centric) View and the Scene as they are, 'boxes' will now be 'components', 'connectors' will now be 'wires', and they will connect via 'sockets'. (Aside: This will also be more in line with what I'll need later on for the RAS project.)


WORK LOG

- Layers
I wanted to ensure that connector lines are drawn behind boxes, but I think the Qt layer model involves only "foreground" and "background", plus a z-axis that seems to be not well integrated into graphic items. So I tried just putting all the boxes into one group, and all the connectors into another -- but that screws up the ability to grab-and-drag the boxes around on the canvas. Bummer. So the groups went away again (leaving just the one for the background grid).

- Wires
My idea with Wires (arrow lines) is to have each Component have 'anchor' points at reasonable positions (middle of sides for (round) rects, pointy bits for rhombi) and then attach the Wires to those points. Also, my idea with lines is to have them be rectangular, so that they will either be I-, L-, or Z- shaped. It would be neat to give them rounded corners, but that's really only nice-to-have. Lines must of course also have an arrow head at the destination, and some lines (out of conditionals, as well as error handlers) should have (program-defined) labels near their source anchor.


MISC. NOTES ('cuz I'm still a Python newbie)

- When moving a selection of several items, perhaps need to temporarily wrap them in a group.
