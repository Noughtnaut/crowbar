TODO
- Make poly boxes work (for Condition)
- Make rudimentary lines work
  - Use QGraphicsPathItem for connectors ... probably
- Add logging for debugging etc.
- Create a dummy folder/flow data structure, and play with the left pane
- Make resources work like they do in Designer
- Don't store entire VENV in git -- see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6590783/145771

REMEMBER
- use scene coordinates, not (necessarily) screen coordinates
