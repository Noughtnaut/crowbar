TODO
- Make rudimentary lines work
  - Use QGraphicsPathItem for connectors ... probably
- Add logging for debugging etc.
- Create a dummy folder/flow data structure, and play with the left pane
- Make resources work like they do in Designer
- Don't store entire VENV in git -- see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6590783/145771
- I shouldn't represent the grid as a QGraphicsItem.
  Instead, I should draw it inside reimplementation of drawBackground().
- Box text should be centered (needs using text instead of static text?)

REMEMBER
- use scene coordinates, not (necessarily) screen coordinates

- When moving a selection of several items, perhaps need to temporarily wrap them in a group.
